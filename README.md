Boggle is a word game that is played on a 4x4 board with 16 letter tiles. 
The goal is to find as many words as possible given a time constraint. 

In this excercise, the following modification has been made.

1. The time contraint is set as 3 minutes.
2. It is possible for one or more of the letter tiles to be blank (denoted by *). 
3. The blank tiles can be treated as any other letter.  
4. Note that in one game it does not have to be the same character for each word.
